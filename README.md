# RadTrans

RadTrans is a neutral-particle, deterministic radiation transport solver in two spatial dimensions.  This repository is a simplified/stripped-down version of a larger code that is kept in a private repository.  The main difference is that private version implements an eigenvalue solver for multiplying media.
